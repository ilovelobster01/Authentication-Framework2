Templates and admin UI notes
- Keep HTML minimal and dependency-free for now.
- Forms use Flask-WTF for CSRF, but the login page uses fetch() to call JSON endpoints (CSRF-exempt since itâ€™s POSTing JSON; if needed, add CSRF token via meta tag and header).
- Admin blueprint is protected by login + admin_required check in before_request.
- Certificates table shows bindings with revoke action.
