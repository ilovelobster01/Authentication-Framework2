Best practices for CA scripts
- Keep CA private key password-protected; scripts never echo the password.
- CRL must be regenerated on every revocation; nginx mounts the CRL file path.
- Avoid writing absolute symlinks in outputs; copy files for docker mounts.
- SANs are appended at runtime to avoid editing config files.
- Client cert PKCS#12 export requires a user-provided password; never default.
- For production, consider using a proper PKI or HSM, automate CRL/OCSP.
